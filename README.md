## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python Flask**: RESTful API server
- **JSON Database**: Simple file-based storage for people and questions
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin requests enabled
- **Local LLM Integration**: Ollama integration for intelligent question generation
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Automatically chooses the best available local model

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful icons

- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the React development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click "Start Game" on the welcome screen
2. **Answer Questions**: Respond with "Yes" or "No" to each question
3. **Watch Progress**: The progress bar shows how close the AI is to guessing
4. **See Results**: The AI will show its best guess with confidence level
5. **Play Again**: Click "Play Again" to start a new game

## Database

The game includes a database of famous people with their traits:

### Sample People
- **Albert Einstein**: Physicist, historical figure, male, has beard
- **Marie Curie**: Scientist, historical figure, female, Nobel Prize winner

### Questions
The AI asks strategic questions to narrow down the person:
- Is this person a scientist?
- Is this person from history?
- Is this person male?
- Is this person still alive?
- Is this person American?
- Does this person have a beard?
- And many more...

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/start`: Start a new game
- `POST /api/answer`: Submit an answer and get next question/result
- `GET /api/people`: Get all people in database
- `GET /api/questions`: Get all available questions

## Customization

### Adding New People

Edit the `initialize_database()` function in `app.py` to add new people:

```python
{
    "id": 9,
    "name": "Your Person Name",
    "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "description": "Brief description of the person",
    "traits": {
        "is_scientist": False,
        "is_historical": False,
        "is_male": True,
        # ... add more traits
    }
}
```

### Adding New Questions

Add new questions to the database:

```python
{"id": 16, "text": "Is this person a sports athlete?", "trait": "is_athlete"}
```
